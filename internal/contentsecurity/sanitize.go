// span the underscore in SECRET_KEY.
//
// The name may be quoted. JSON, Terraform and every config file written in them
// spell the pair as "password": "hunter2", and reading only the bare form put
// the closing quote between the name and the colon, so the rule never matched:
// an appsettings.json or a Postman collection was indexed, and returned in a
// snippet, with its credential intact. The quotes are optional on both sides,
// so the bare form still matches exactly as it did.
//
// An assignment is one line. Written with \s the rule ran past the end of it
// and took the next line's first word as the value, which YAML makes constant:
// "secret:" and "token:" are ordinary section headers, and a Kubernetes volume
// that says
//
//	secret:
//	  secretName: db-creds
//
// came back as "secret: [REDACTED] db-creds" — the key masked, the value left,
// a security event raised for a manifest holding no credential, and a line gone
